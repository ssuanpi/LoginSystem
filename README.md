First of all, this will not be your typical ReadMe file, it's going to be more like a update log and stuff, so yea...

This is a login system that i developed while learning java. Don't think I'll upgrade it anytime soon but once I learn to work databases, I'll try and hook the proyect up with one
and be able to add new usernames and that stuff. 
(I know that it can also be done using an array, with a xlsx or a csv or manually adding more, but I want to do this using databases).

Okay I did it with an array even tho I said I was going to make upgrade it until databases because I was on a train and I was bored.
