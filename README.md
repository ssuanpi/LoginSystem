This is a login system that i developed while learning java. Don't think I'll upgrade it anytime soon but once I learn to work databases, I'll try and hook the proyect up with one
and be able to add new usernames and that stuff. 
(I know that it can also be done using an array, with a xlsx or a csv or manually adding more, but I want to do this using databases).
